# Transmission with python

Transmission docker container with python

This docker container uses [dperson/transmission](https://github.com/dperson/transmission) image as a base image and adds python. Mainly because I want to run a python script when torrents complete.

For instructions on how to run this contianer see [dperson/transmission](https://github.com/dperson/transmission).
